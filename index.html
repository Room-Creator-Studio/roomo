                In a world that never stops talking, your silence isn't an absence—it's a strength. 
                We know what it's like to feel unseen in the roar of digital noise, where the pressure to perform often outweighs the need to be heard. 
                ROOM is built for those who prefer the gentle hum of a small conversation over the spotlight of a feed. 
                Here, you don't have to shout to exist or post to belong. 
                It's a place to find beauty in the quiet moments and connect with others who value real presence over constant performance.
